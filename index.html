								<h2>Biography</h2>
							</header>
							<p>I'm Rabiie, I studied electronics for 4 years total, I'm also a self-taught programmer and developer with over 3 years of experience, currently working on my first major project, as well as looking into publishing my first paper, I'm familiar with a number of languages and tools, but I stick to C++ & Visual Studio because it suits all of my needs, I've also been using a framework called SFML for all of my game/graphics related projects instead of a game engine up until this point, to better familiarize myself with programming, since engines do most of the work for you.</p>
							<p>I love conceptualizing and then realizing systems of all kinds, there's something so beautiful about small components working together as part of a larger whole fulfilling a certain function.</p>
							<p>My interests include robotics, gaming & game development, cooking & sketching.</p>

									<h3>R-CAEn</h3>
								</header>
								<p>My current personal project, R-CAEn (pronounced 'Arcane'), is a cellular-automata-based game engine that greatly facilitates the creation and simulation of cellular automata, as well as possessing many other features such as layer-to-layer communication and greatly improved performance thanks to the CBPO (Chunk-Based Performance Optimization) algorithm I developed.</p>

									<h3>Chunk-Based Performance Optimization Algorithm</h3>
								</header>
								<p>While developing R-CAEn, I noticed a steep performace drop as a result of all the function calls, so in my quest for optimization, I developed the "Chunk-Based Performance Optimization Algorithm For Two-Dimensional Square Lattice Cellular Automata", which in essence, marks the active parts of the grid to be iterated over, instead of iterating over every single cell, every single step, greatly improving performance in most cases.</p>

									<h3>Montrez Vos Muscles!</h3>
								</header>
								<p>This is the project I worked on towards the end of my internship at Digital Mania Studio, it is my first ever professional work experience.</p>
								<p>It is a game that uses Intel's RealSense™ motion-tracking technology, and Nuitrack's skeletal tracking SDK to allow the player to move an avatar in real time.
								<br>I worked on the initial tracking system, the player's X-ray shader, the wall texture shader, the score system, and the UI functionality & animation.</p>
								<p>The client ended up abandoning the project when they realized the idea was too ambitious.</p>

									<h3>Warshmallows</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Warshmallows is DigitalMania's flagship title, and while I wasn't involved in it's development as that happened before I joined them, I still took it upon myself to contribute to the project even after it's release.</p>
								<p>I tasked myself with proofreading and correcting the game's English localization, which was subpar at the time.
								<br>I also wrote a 60-page game design proposal about improving the game's design, specifically in the area of game feel.

								<p>I developed this as a tech demo for DigitalMania Studio.</p>

								<p>This framework features an asset manager, polished controls, basic top-down physics, rudimentary enemy AI, collision, and a fully-functioning 2D replica of Half-Life 2's gravity gun.</p>

								<p>During my second internship, I was tasked with developing a prototype for a system that tracks the location of a train in real-time, and sends the coordiantes to a Unity3D simulated model, from which the train can be remotely controlled.</p>
								<p>The results were not ideal, but I did my best with the materials I was provided, and learned a lot about working with Arduino and Unity3D in the process.</p>
